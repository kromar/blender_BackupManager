# Blender Backup Manager

This addon is in development, i recommend making a manual backup before start to use this addon.

This addon lets you backup and restore your Blender settings to a specified location so it can easy be shared via cloud folders or networks.


## Simple 
In the simple mode the addon is backing-up or restoring the version of the active blender application.
You can see the age and the size of your last backup, by default cache is excluded from the backup due to generated files which take a lot of space (it can be enabled in the advanced options)
