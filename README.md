# Blender Backup Manager

This addon is in early development stage so i recommend making some manual backup first before starting to use this addon.

This addon lets you backup and restore your beldner version settings to a specified location so it can easy be shared via cloud folders or networks.

What is still planned:
- selective backup and restore. Select specific parts to backup. for example presets
- separate free from - to version selection so a version can be copied to anything you like and restored from any path to your version
